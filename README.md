Overview
This project implements a production-grade dual-layer intrusion detection system that identifies zero-day attacks by learning exclusively from benign network traffic and system activity. The system combines:

Network Layer: CIC-IDS 2017 dataset analysis using association rule mining on sliding windows

Host Layer: ADFA-LD system call trace analysis using behavioral pattern discovery

Fusion Layer: OR-logic correlation of independent detection signals

Key Innovation: Unsupervised learning from normal behavior only—no labeled attack data required during training.

Performance: Achieves 92.6% recall on known attacks and 54.3% on unseen zero-day attack families.

Technical Methodology
Core Innovation: Association Rule Mining

1. Learn normal patterns from benign data only:
   {HIGH_flow_rate, LOW_packet_size, port_80} → normal (conf: 0.92)

2. Score new traffic against normal rules:
   anomaly_score = violated_weight / applicable_weight

3. Alert on significant deviations (threshold > 0.10)
Rule Quality Metrics

Minimum Support:    ≥ 0.05 (5% of transactions)
Minimum Confidence: ≥ 0.82 (82% reliability)  
Minimum Lift:       ≥ 1.8 (1.8x more likely than random)
